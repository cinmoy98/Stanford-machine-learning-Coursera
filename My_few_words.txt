Hello,
Everyone.......

I started learning Machine learning from Stanford online which was offered by coursera in the August,2019.
There I have to complete total 8 assignments.The assignments were awsome.Course instructor Andrew ng only taught
the theoretical concepts.But in the assignments i have to deal with the code without any prior 
knowledge.So these assignments were chanllenging and fun to me.

Here you will find the assignments I have completed those days.
I highly recommend the course if you want to dive into the deep of ML.
